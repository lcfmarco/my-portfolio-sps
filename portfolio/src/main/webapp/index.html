      <h1>Marco's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio. Welcome!</p>
      <p>A little bit about myself: I am from Hong Kong and I use he/him pronouns. </p>
      <p>If I had to sum myself up into a couple words, it would take me a lifetime because I am an incredibly indecisive person.</p>
      <p>Being indecisive has its ups and downs though I guess, which may sound odd because being indecisive sounds more negative than positive.</p>
      <p>Generally, being indecisive is completely fine with me because I am typically very okay with anything...</p>
      <p>But the struggle comes when you are with a group of indecisive people!</p>
      <p>You and the group could literally sit for 30 minutes in a restaurant, all looking at the menu, and still not decide on what to order. It truly is a magical thing.</p>
      <p>Some of my favorite movies I've watched recently: After Yang, Rushmore, Top Gun: Maverick, and Another Round</p>

      <p>I'll keep this hidden under here real quick, but I also have a fear of stickers. Please don't force exposure therapy like all my friends already do :(</p>
